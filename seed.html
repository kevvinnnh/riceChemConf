                <p class="lead">The Rice University Office of the Vice Provost for Academic Affairs and the Office of Research have initiated a program to fund “seed grants” for new projects that support the university’s research and scholarship mission.</p>
                <p class="lead">Seed grants provide funds to initiate projects, demonstrate feasibility of new ideas, and/or generate preliminary data for proposals to external sponsors. These grants are intended to promote collaborative projects between investigators from different disciplines, and to enable investigators to pursue new and creative ideas with potential for high impact.</p>
                <p class="lead">Seed grant funds should not be used to supplement or extend existing grant projects, nor should they be used to purchase equipment or supplies for an existing research program. Grants are typically for one year, and the maximum award amount is $25,000.</p>
